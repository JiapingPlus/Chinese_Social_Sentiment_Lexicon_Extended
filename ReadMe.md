## About this project

This project is based on the *Chinese Social Evaluative Word List* (Li, Chen, & Chuan-Peng, 2023) and aims to expand a set of 1,133 Chinese words across five dimensions of social evaluation. We employed the Word2Vec word embedding method to computationally extend the original word list and conducted a series of reliability and validity tests on the expanded lexicon.

For validity assessment, machine learning classification algorithms were used to evaluate the semantic consistency of the expanded terms. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to examine the strength of association between the expanded and original word lists.
